This is useful when you want to perform similar operations on two sets of data. For example, if you have two arrays representing the red and green color values for a series of LEDs, you can use a single loop to set both colors simultaneously.\n                <pre><code>\n                    int reds[3] = {2,4,6};\n                    int greens[3] = {3,5,7};\n\n                    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n                      digitalWrite(reds[i], HIGH);\n                      digitalWrite(greens[i], HIGH);\n                      delay(100);\n                    }\n                </code></pre>\n                In the example above, we loop through both the reds and greens arrays using the same index variable `i`. This allows us to set the corresponding red and green LEDs to HIGH in each iteration of the loop.\n        </div>\n  </details>\n\n  <h2>Hints</h2>\n  <ol class=\"hints\">\n    <li>One of your <code>for</code> loops should index two arrays at once to turn everything off.</li>\n    <li>The next for loop will turn on the arrays at the same time.</li>\n    <li>For the last for loop, start with a different index value.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n"}
