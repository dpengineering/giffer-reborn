  <h1>The Duality of Arrays</h1>

    <details>
    <summary>NEW: Double Indexing</summary>
        <div class="description">
                We can index two arrays in a single for loop. This is useful when you want to perform similar operations on two sets of data. For example, if you have two arrays representing the red and green color values for a series of LEDs, you can use a single loop to set both colors simultaneously.
                <pre><code>
                    int reds[3] = {2,4,6};
                    int greens[3] = {3,5,7};

                    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                      digitalWrite(reds[i], HIGH);
                      digitalWrite(greens[i], HIGH);
                      delay(100);
                    }
                </code></pre>
                In the example above, we loop through both the reds and greens arrays using the same index variable `i`. This allows us to set the corresponding red and green LEDs to HIGH in each iteration of the loop.
        </div>

  <h2>Hints</h2>
  <ol class="hints">
    <li>One of your <code>for</code> loops should index two arrays at once to turn everything off.</li>
    <li>The next for loop will turn on the arrays at the same time.</li>
    <li>For the last for loop, start with a different index value.</li>
  </ol>
