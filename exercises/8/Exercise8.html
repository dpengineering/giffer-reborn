  <h1>Let's Loop</h1>


  <details>
    <summary>NEW: Multiple variables</summary>
    <div class="description">
      <span class="code">blinkTime</span> and <span class="code">count</span> are both variables. You can have as many variables as you want, just be sure to give each one a unique name.
    </div>
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>NEW: <span class="code">while(count <= 4)</span></summary>
    <div class="description">
        A <strong>while loop</strong> will continue to execute the code inside its curly braces <span class="code">{ }</span> as long as the condition inside the parentheses <span class="code">( )</span> is true. 
        In this case, the code will keep executing as long as the variable <span class="code">count</span> is less than or equal to 4.
        <br>
        Be careful to ensure that the condition will eventually become false, otherwise the loop will run forever!
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>NEW: <span class="code">count += 1;</span></summary>
    <div class="description">
        This is a shorthand way of writing <span class="code">count = count + 1;</span>. It takes the current value of <span class="code">count</span>, adds 1 to it, and then stores that new value back into the variable <span class="code">count</span>.
        <br>
        Other shorthand operators include: <span class="code">-=</span>, <span class="code">*=</span>, and <span class="code">/=</span>.
    </div>
