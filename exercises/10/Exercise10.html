    <summary>NEW: Spaghetti Code</summary>
    <div class="description">
        When you have repetitive sections of code, it can sometimes lead to what's called "spaghetti code." This happens when the logic becomes tangled and hard to follow, much like a bowl of spaghetti.
        <br>
        To avoid this, make sure to keep your code organized and well-commented.
