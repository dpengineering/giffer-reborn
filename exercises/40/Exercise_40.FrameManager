They are useful for grouping items together, even if they are not in a specific order.\n                <pre><code>\n                    int reds[4] = {2,4,6,8};\n                    int greens[3] = {3,5,7};\n                </code>\n                </pre>\n                In the example above, we create two arrays that hold int values.

In this case, we can group our LED pin numbers into an array. \n                This allows us to easily reference and manipulate multiple LEDs using loops. \n                Each LED's pin number is stored at a specific index in the array, starting from 0. \n                For example, if we have an array `ledPins` with values `{2, 3, 4, 5}`, `ledPins[0]` refers to pin 2, `ledPins[1]` refers to pin 3, and so on. \n                By using loops, we can iterate through the array indices to control each LED in sequence or simultaneously.\n                <pre><code>\n                    void blinkArray(int ledArr[], int arrLength, int t){\n                        for (int i=0; i < arrLength; i++){\n                          digitalWrite(ledArr[i], HIGH);\n                        }\n                        delay(t);\n                        \n                        for (int i=0; i < arrLength; i++){\n                          digitalWrite(ledArr[i], LOW);\n                        }\n                        delay(t);\n                      }\n                </code>\n                </pre>\n                In the example above, blinkArray indexes through the ledArr array to turn on and off each LED in the array.\n        </div>\n  </details>\n\n  <h2>Hints</h2>\n  <ol class=\"hints\">\n    <li>Use Ctrl+C to copy and Ctrl+V to paste.</li>\n    <li>Make sure you are also passing in the correct array lengths.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n"}
