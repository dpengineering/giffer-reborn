    <summary>NEW: <span class="code">int x</span></summary>
    <div class="description">
        DESCRIPTION: Creates an integer variable named  `x`. This creates a location in Arduino's memory named “x” that is used to store an integer value. 
        Integers can have values as small as -32,768 and as large as +32768.
        <br>
        Why use variables? Because variables allow our programs to be dynamic/flexible.
