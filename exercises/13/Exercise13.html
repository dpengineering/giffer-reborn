    <summary>NEW: Back to Back While Loops</summary>
    <div class="description">
        You can have multiple while loops in a row to create more complex patterns. For example, you can have one while loop that lights up LEDs from 2 to 8, and then another while loop that lights them back down from 7 to 3.
    </div>
  </details>

  <h2>Hints</h2>
  <ol class="hints">
    <li>Create a while loop that moves upwards first.</li>
    <li>Copy and paste that loop underneath itself. Modify the copy to blink downwards.</li>
    <li>Did you flip your inequality symbol?</li>
  </ol>
