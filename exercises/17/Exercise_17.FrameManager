A <code>for</code> loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat a block of code a specific number of times. It consists of three main parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.</p>\n        <p>The syntax for a <code>for</code> loop is as follows:</p>\n        <pre><code>for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) \n        {\n          // Code to be executed \n        }</code></pre>\n        <p>Here's a breakdown of each part:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> This part is executed once at the beginning of the loop. It is typically used to declare and initialize a loop control variable.</li>\n            <li><strong>Condition:</strong> This part is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed. If it is false, the loop terminates.</li>\n            <li><strong>Increment/Decrement:</strong> This part is executed after each iteration of the loop. It is typically used to update the loop control variable.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n  </details>\n\n  <h2>Hints</h2>\n  <ol class=\"hints\">\n    <li>In what ways does a for loop differ from a while loop?</li>\n    <li>In what ways are they similar?</li>\n  </ol>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n"}
