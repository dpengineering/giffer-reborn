  <h1>For Loops: While Loop's Cooler Cousin</h1>

    <div class="description">
        <p>We can use a <code>for</code> loop to make our code more concise. A <code>for</code> loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat a block of code a specific number of times. It consists of three main parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.</p>
        <p>The syntax for a <code>for</code> loop is as follows:</p>
        <pre><code>for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) 
        {
          // Code to be executed 
        }</code></pre>
        <p>Here's a breakdown of each part:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> This part is executed once at the beginning of the loop. It is typically used to declare and initialize a loop control variable.</li>
            <li><strong>Condition:</strong> This part is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed. If it is false, the loop terminates.</li>
            <li><strong>Increment/Decrement:</strong> This part is executed after each iteration of the loop. It is typically used to update the loop control variable.</li>
        </ul>
