    <summary>NEW: Nested Loops</summary>
    <div class="description">
        A loop inside another loop is called a nested loop. The inner loop will complete all its iterations for each iteration of the outer loop. This is useful for tasks that require multiple levels of repetition.
    </div>
  </details>

  <h2>Hints</h2>
  <ol class="hints">
    <li>You have examples of for loops from previous exercises that keep track of repetition counts.</li>
    <li>Follow your approach from exercise 10, how did you minimize repetition?</li>
    <li>Place the starter for loop inside of the loop body of a count-based for loop.</li>
  </ol>
