    <summary>NEW: Blinking Two LEDs at Once</summary>
    <div class="description">
        In order to blink two LEDs at the same time, you can use two <code>digitalWrite</code> commands in a row. 
        For example, if you want to blink LED 3 and LED 5 together, you would write:
        <pre><code>
        digitalWrite(3, HIGH);
        digitalWrite(5, HIGH);
        delay(500);
        digitalWrite(3, LOW);
        digitalWrite(5, LOW);
        delay(500);
        </code></pre>
  </details>

  <h2>Hints</h2>
  <ol class="hints">
    <li>Ignore the ledNum variable for now and try to turn on two LEDs at once.</li>
    <li>What do you notice about both sides of LEDs? Is there a pattern in the pin numbers?</li>
    <li>How can you capture this pattern inside the while loop?</li>
  </ol>
