    <summary>NEW: Multiple while loops</summary>
    <div class="description">
        You can have as many <strong>while loops</strong> as you want in your code. Each one will execute independently based on its own condition.
        <br>
        Just be careful to ensure that each loop's condition will eventually become false, otherwise you may create an infinite loop that never ends!

  <h2>Hints</h2>
  <ol class="hints">
    <li>What do you notice about the blink counts of each LED? Any pattern?</li>
    <li>Are you resetting the count before each while loop?</li>
  </ol>
